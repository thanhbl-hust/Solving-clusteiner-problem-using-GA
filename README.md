## Reason 

Subject: `Evolutionary Computation - HUST - 2022.2`

`What is Clustered - Steiner?`

* `Steiner Tree`: The Steiner tree problem or the problem of finding the shortest path from two given points is developed based on the Fermat problem of the famous French mathematician. In the 19th century, Steiner generalized Fermat's problem by not limiting the number of points to be found.

* `Application of CluSteiner`: applications of the Steiner Tree can be said as
   * Circuit layout on the circuit board
   * Connect the network at the lowest cost
   * And applications related to finding the smallest distance in the plane such as traffic systems, water supply systems, power supply systems, network cables ...
## How can i do this project

We try to solve problem with 2 ways below:
- Genetic Algorithm by [PhD. Huynh Thi Thanh Binh](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/pgs-ts-huynh-thi-thanh-binh.html) and partners.

- Proposed Algorithm shown in `Clu-Steiner.pdf` by my group.
